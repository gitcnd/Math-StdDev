# Math-StdDev
Math::StdDev - Pure-perl mean and variance computation supporting running/online calculation (Welford's algorithm)


# SYNOPSIS

```perl
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
      
    use Math::StdDev;

    my $d = new Math::StdDev();
    $d->Update(2);
    $d->Update(3);
    print $d->mean() . "\t" . $d->sampleVariance();
```

or

```bash
    perl -MMath::StdDev -e '$d=new Math::StdDev; $d->Update(10**8+4, 10**8 + 7, 10**8 + 13, 10**8 + 16); print $d->mean() . "\n" . $d->sampleVariance() . "\n"'
```

# DESCRIPTION

This module impliments Welford's online algorithm (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms\_for\_calculating\_variance )
Maybe one day in future the two-pass algo could be included, along with Kahan compensated summation... so much math, so little time...

## EXPORT

None by default.

## Notes

## new

Usage is

```perl
    my $d = new Math::StdDev();
```
or
```perl
    my $d = new Math::StdDev(1,2,3,4);  # Add one or more samples, or a population, right from the start
```

## Update

Usage is

```perl
    my $d->Update(123);
```
or
```perl
    my $d->Update(@list_of_scalars);
```

## mean

Usage is

```perl
    print $d->mean();
```

## variance

Usage is

```perl
    print $d->variance();
```

## sampkleVariance

(same as variance, but uses n-1 divisor.)  Usage is:

```perl
    print $d->sampleVariance();
```
